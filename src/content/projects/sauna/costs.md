# Costs

Below are all of the tracked costs for the sauna. Initially, I was pretty good at logging these, but as the project dragged on, I definitely missed some. I tried to add the biggest ticket items though. 

## Door
I search far and wide for a used door, but for the life of me, could not find what I was looking for. I needed 1) exterior 2) left hand in-swing 3) glass 4) frame included. No one on Facebook had this, so had to buy new. I think it was worth it. There were cheaper exterior doors but they did not have the glass I wanted.

## Windows
I saved quite a bit by finding used, tempered windows and dismantling them. This was definitely more work, and the framing work was one of the things I was most uncertain about. Thankfully I have 2ft eaves, so my windows don't get that much moisture exposure. Time will tell if I did the flashing + water-proofing correctly.

While I think this is a good move if you're on a budget sauna, it slowled my project down since I had to design around the used windows I was able to find. I think next time I might consider buying custom cut tempered glass to make the design + build easier.
